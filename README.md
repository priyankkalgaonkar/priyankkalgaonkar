# Hey, I'm Priyank 👋

I am a doctoral student and a research fellow at the Purdue School of Engineering (_Purdue University, Indianapolis_), and graduated from the _University of Toledo_ in Ohio with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, and a M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from _Purdue University, Indianapolis_. I have also previously served as a Clinical Systems Engineer at The Christ Hospital for Renovo Solutions in Cincinnati and as a Telemetry Developer Intern at Philips North America in Cleveland. I was most recently nominated for the prestigious IUPUI Elite 50 award and have published two award winning research papers and three research journals. My activities are much beyond my stream of education and research. ⚡ Outside of academia, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During the warmer months here in Indiana, I enjoy mountain biking, hiking, free climbing, kayaking and traveling with friends and family. When forced indoors, I like to watch sci-fi and sitcom genre movies and TV shows.
